# Hydro CSS

Hydro CSS is the CSS aspect of the Hydro Framework. It is written in Sass/SCSS language. It's purpose is to help web developers create cross-browser consistent styles, as well as provide numerous tools and encourage a logical, modular project structure.

## Purposes & Goals

The framework includes a purposefully small but incredibly versatile set of components. It's aim is to keep CSS file sizes small while still providing a comprehensive set of modules. It leverages the latest in browser technology while supporting all the way down to IE8.

It accomplishes this by not making any assumptions about how you want to organise your styles. Hydro CSS does not come preloaded with button, field and heading styles. These are opt-in aspects to the framework. It also only includes components that are necessary from a cross-browser and complexity point of view. So structural elements (like columns) are built in but things like table styles and markers are up to you to implement.

Of course, we recognise the usefulness of a framework that sets up these base styles for you. And with that a style-based addon to the framework is on our roadmap.
